As the warnings indicate to start recovery process (and to resume DFS replication) you have to issue following command at an elevated command prompt:

wmic /namespace:\\root\microsoftdfs path dfsrVolumeConfig where volumeGuid="<GUID>" call ResumeReplication
(Where <GUID> - ID specified in the above warnings.)

Replication is not resumed automatically in order to give system administrator opportunity to backup replicated folders before starting recovery.
If you prefer for replication to resume automatically you need make following registry change:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DFSR\Parameters
StopReplicationOnAutoRecovery = 0

Default StopReplicationOnAutoRecovery value on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Server 2012 is "1". On Windows Server 2012 R2 it's "0".
